## Pull Request template
Please, go through these steps before you submit a PR.

1. Make sure that your PR is not a duplicate.
2. If not, then make sure that:

  2.1. You have done your changes in your fork. PR must have descriptive names that start with either the `fix/` or `feature/` prefixes. Good examples are: `fix/signin-issue` or `feature/issue-templates`.

  2.2. You have descriptive commit messages with a short title -explain your changes.
    2.2.1. Commit messages must not be too long.
    2.2.2. Please use proper syntax <3.
  

3. **After** these steps, you're ready to open a pull request.

  3.1. Your pull request MUST NOT target the `master` branch on this repository. You probably want to target `staging` instead.

  3.2. Give a descriptive title to your PR.

  3.3. Provide a description of your changes.

  3.4. Put `closes #XXXX` in your comment to auto-close the issue that your PR fixes (if such).

**PLEASE REMOVE THIS TEMPLATE BEFORE SUBMITTING**
